# landing-page

Welcome to my second TOP project where I am supposed to brag about my CSS skills. Jokes aside, this repository is my journey
towards learning (and mastering) Web Development with TOP (The Odin Project). And this page specifically is for self-reflection
after I have finished working with the project (to its requirements as per TOP).

~~Except, the problem is, I haven't even started the project yet~~ :-)

Finished it. Took me about 3 days, I think. Whatever, I didn't count so doesn't matter.

### Time for Self-reflection
The biggest hurdle was determining how much pixels to use in width, height, margin, and padding of the elements. As perfectionistic as I am, I solved this by using a ruler, the very thing TOP ordered me not to use. Hehe.

Things were not easy, definitely. I still feel like I didn't do a good job with the git commit messages. I'll be trying to improve that. Another problem was sticking things the right way on the page, which was quite difficult. And understandably so.

For now there is nothing very drastic to report on.
