Welcome to my second TOP project where I am supposed to brag about my CSS skills. Jokes aside, this repository is my journey
towards learning (and mastering) Web Development with TOP (The Odin Project). And this page specifically is for self-reflection
after I have finished working with the project (to its requirements as per TOP).

Except, the problem is, I haven't even started the project yet :-)
